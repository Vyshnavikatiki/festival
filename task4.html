                <h2>About the event</h2>
                <p>Makar Sankranti is one of the important festivals in India, which is dedicated to the Sun God and marks the end of winter. Also known as the harvest festival, Makar Sankranti marks the transit of the Sun into Makara Rashi (Capricorn constellation or zodiac). Makar Sankranti 2025 is on Tuesday, January 14th. It heralds the start of longer days, and the Sun moves northward, which is why this period is known as Uttarayan and is considered very auspicious. Makar Sankranti is celebrated according to the lunar calendar, so it falls almost on the same day every year. 

Auspicious Time for Worship, Donation, and Bathing on Makar Sankranti:
Punyakaal: 09:03 AM to 05:46 PM on 14th January 2025

Maha Punyakaal: 09:03 AM to 10:48 AM

These are considered the most auspicious times for worship, making donations, and performing sacred baths on Makar Sankranti.

                    <p>On Bhogi, people discard old and derelict things and concentrate on new things causing change or transformation. At dawn, people light bonfires with logs of wood, other solid-fuels, and wooden furniture at home that are no longer useful. This marks the end of the year's accounts and the beginning of new accounts on the first day of the harvest on the following day. Lord Indra is worshipped during the Pongal festival for the blessing of rains.Students join their families and communities to light bonfires early in the morning, symbolizing the discarding of old, unwanted things and embracing a fresh start.They gather with friends to enjoy the warmth of the fire, sometimes singing traditional songs or playing music.Students participate in drawing colorful rangolis (kolams) using rice flour, natural powders, or synthetic colors outside their homes or in school premises</p>

                    <p>Makar(a) SankrƒÅnti (Sanskrit: ‡§Æ‡§ï‡§∞‡§∏‡§ô‡•ç‡§ï‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ‡§®‡•ç‡§§‡§ø, romanized: Makarasa·πÖkrƒÅnti),[1] (transl.‚ÄâCapricorn Festival) also referred to as UttarƒÅyana, Makara, or simply SankrƒÅnti, is a Hindu observance and a festival. Usually falling on the date of 14 January annually (15 January on a leap year),[2][3][4] this occasion marks the transition of the sun from the zodiac of Sagittarius (dhanu) to Capricorn (makara).[2][5][6] Since the sun has made this transition which vaguely coincides with moving from south to north, the festival is dedicated to the solar deity, Surya,[7] and is observed to mark a new beginning.[8] Many multi-day festivals are organised on this occasion all over India.Flying kites is a hallmark of Sankranti, especially in states like Gujarat, Telangana, and Rajasthan. Students gather on rooftops or open fields to fly kites and compete to cut others' kites.This activity brings friends and neighbors together for a lively, colorful celebration.</p>
